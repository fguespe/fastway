### 🏎 Performance

**It only weights 500KB**. It has the minimum libraries needed for creating great websites. Also has built in a lot of functionality eliminating the need for extra plugins, which is essential for performance.

## 👨🏼‍💻Efficiency

With multiple theme options i can manage to update things across all the site from a centralized command. Also it is really fast to create websites. I'm able to create a site in a couple of hours.

### 🛠 Maintenance

Provides customer ready dashboard so clients can perform the most important and urgent tasks making the tech support load more light. Also has every little thing every customer ask over the time.

### 👨🏼‍💻 For developers

It's very easy to make a fork of it and continue to add functionality. I have a local install of fastway and when i push changes to bitbucket its automatically updated in all the 200 sites i maintain.
