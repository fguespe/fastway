# WooCommerce Framework

Hi everyone, my name is Fabrizio Guespe and i am the CEO of Altoweb, a web design Agency, specialized in E-commerce. I've been developing this Wordpress theme for 5 years, only for internal use, until now. I have developed more than 1000 websites using this framework and i think it's essential for running a web design business in an efficient manner.

# ‚ö°Ô∏èWhy Fastway?

Over the years i tried all the available themes in the market but i was always frustrated. They were very slow, loaded with tons of javascript very difficult to customize. Also weren't a good fit for my expanding business because they were very inefficient for making changes across the whole page. Fastway is optimized for: 

### üèé Performance

**It only weights 500KB**. It has the minimum libraries needed for creating great websites. Also has built in a lot of functionality eliminating the need for extra plugins, which is essential for performance.

## üë®üèº‚ÄçüíªEfficiency

With multiple theme options i can manage to update things across all the site from a centralized command. Also it is really fast to create websites. I'm able to create a site in a couple of hours.

### üõ† Maintenance

Provides customer ready dashboard so clients can perform the most important and urgent tasks making the tech support load more light. Also has every little thing every customer ask over the time.

### üë®üèº‚Äçüíª For developers

It's very easy to make a fork of it and continue to add functionality. I have a local install of fastway and when i push changes to bitbucket its automatically updated in all the 200 sites i maintain.

### üëÅ 100% in Customizer

---

You have everything you need in the Wordpress native customizer, making possible to preview all changes instantly.

### üìê Shortcode Layouts

---

I created a new framework to be able to code unlimited possibilites with quality code and shortcodes. This allows to create any design in the most complex parts and be flexible to the clients. Adding small details now is easy.

### üîù Popup Builder

No need to use  heavy plugins. Just code your own with html and shortcodes.

### üôé‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Client Area

---

Client Area gives you control and professionalism over what your clients can do and see. You can add custom menu items whenever you want.

### üìû Company Data

---

With Company Data variables you only type once the contact data of your clients. Then you can call them anywhere in the site with shortcodes. This allows consistency in the long term because changes are only made in one place, avoiding lots of errors. You can also specify multiple values and refer them via index.
